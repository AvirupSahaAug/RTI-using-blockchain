# RTI-using-blockchain


currently need to work on adding a way to only show officers who are there without any jobs assigned to them
 also need to add the logic to identify officers who are not working 
 need to implement a way to ensure that the file type stays intact when the user uploads and downloads currently the thing just gets fucked up like the thing opens if the right app is used but thats all the user  or the officer or the admin cant be sure that the file type is there fix that (priority one)
